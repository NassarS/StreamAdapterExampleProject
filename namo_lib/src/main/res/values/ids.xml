    Ad text.
    <p>
    Specifying either the ad text id or title id is required. Ad text will be longer than the ad
    title, typically between 2 and 5 lines of medium size font a large display phone. If
    you show both the title and text, you should display the title above the text.

    The advertiser icon image view.
    <p>
    Specifying this id is optional. If you display both the advertiser name and icon, we

    minimum size of 14x14dp.

  <!--
    The primary ad image view.
    <p>
    Specifying this id is  required. You may show the image at whatever dimensions you wish within a
    reasonable aspect ratio for your app, although we recommend a minimum height and width of 80pt,
    and and aspect ration between 3:1 and 4:7. The image returned from the Namo ad servers will be
    scaled and cropped according the image metadata associated with the ad, which describes a
    desired hotspot to keep visible, and a scaling algorithm to resize the image appropriately.

    The view that will trigger the click action.
    <p>
    Specifying this id is optional. Include this id in your layout to override the default click
